This application takes inspiration from the official Google VR SDK sample and it is a simple virtual reality game where the player has to collect some objects that will appear on the scene.
In our version, the player can move into the room to collect far away objects. It is also more difficult than the original version because there are different types of collectable objects in the scene at the same time, which will disappear after a fixed amount of time. 

The application has been developed using the framework Google VR Java API, but has a strict integration with OpenGL library, to manage all operations related to the rendering of 3D objects.
